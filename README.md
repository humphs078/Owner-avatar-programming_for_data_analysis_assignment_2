## Problem Statement

+ Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.

+ Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)

+ Examine Irish context:
    
    + [Climate change signals](/literature/the_emergence_of_a_climate_change_signal_in_long_term_irish_meteorological_observations.pdf) : (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect)

+ Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats

+ For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).

+ Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to
published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue

+ Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-ice-coverage)
